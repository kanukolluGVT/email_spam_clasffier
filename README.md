### Steps:
1. Load data from local directory
2. Clean data i.e, remove stop words make case small
3. Pre-process data (using Google's word embeddings or TF-IDF vectorizer based on laptop specifications)
4. Split data into test and train sets
5. Train a deep learning model on the feature vectors using the training data (X_train and y_train)
6. Predict on X_test to get y_test_predicted; compare with y_test_actual
7. Calculate metrics
8. conclusion and steps to increase performance

### conclusion:
Steps for Improving Model Performance:

Enhanced Word Embeddings:

Utilize more informative embeddings like Google's 512-dimensional vector embeddings for increased accuracy, precision, and F1 score.

Complex Deep Learning Models:

Consider employing more complex deep learning models that can benefit from a larger dataset to enhance performance.

Handling Unbalanced Data:

Address the unbalanced dataset by creating a balanced dataset to improve the model's ability to generalize.

Focus on Recall:

Concentrate on maximizing recall to reduce false negatives, especially for dangerous misclassifications like marking spam emails as ham.
Implement techniques like oversampling, adjusting class weights, or lowering the threshold to increase recall.

Ensemble Methods:

Employ ensemble methods such as voting classifiers to merge predictions from multiple models, leveraging their diverse strengths for better classification outcomes.

Regularization and Hyperparameter Tuning:

Regularize models to mitigate overfitting risks and fine-tune hyperparameters through cross-validation to optimize performance on validation data.

You can use these steps to enhance the model's performance and tackle specific challenges like decreasing false negatives and improving overall metrics.
